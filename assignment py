Declaring a Variable: This involves specifying the variable's name and data type. For example, in languages like Java or C++, you declare a variable by stating its type followed by its name, e.g., int age;. In Python, you don't explicitly declare the type; instead, you directly assign a value, and Python infers the type.
2. Assigning a Variable: This involves giving a value to a declared variable. For instance, after declaring int age; in Java or C++, you can assign it a value like age = 25;. In Python, declaration and assignment are combined into a single step: age = 25.



age = "8"
length = "56.90"
height = "*34.09944"

age = int(age)
length = float(length)
height = float(height.replace("*", ""))

print("Age:", age, type(age))
print("Length:", length, type(length))
print("Height:", height, type(height))


print("welcome to mark allocator")
number = int(input("please enter a number between 0 and 100:"))
if number < 0 or number > 100:
    print("invalid, no mark")
elif number <= 39:
    print("allocate F")
elif number <= 49:
    print("allocate E")
elif number <= 59:
    print("allocate D")
elif number <= 69:
    print("allocate C")
elif number <= 79:
    print("allocate B")
elif number <= 89:
    print("allocate A")
elif number <= 100:
     print("allocate A+")
